## Hi, I’m Vahid Mirjalili 👋

I’m a Machine Learning Research Scientist with expertise in building and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), multi-modal models, and deep learning systems. With a strong background in **Computer Vision**, **Natural Language Processing**, and building **Multimodal Language and Vision models**, I’m passionate about creating innovative solutions to solve real-world problems.

### 🎥 Check out my YouTube Channel
I regularly post tutorials and deep dives into machine learning topics on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCquhhue4JeJv_2dXXpib48Q).

### 📚 Books
I have authored several books on machine learning, including **"Python Machine Learning"** and **"Machine Learning with PyTorch and scikit-learn"**, and I’m currently working on **"Grokking Transformers"**, which is being published by Manning.
